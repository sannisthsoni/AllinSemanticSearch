            <mark>Hey everybody. Welcome to the all in podcast with Jason Calacanis and Plymouth Palihapitiya, we record this podcast well on a, on a really unique schedule tomorrow. What's our schedule right now, whenever we feel like it basically it is. Whenever our significant others get so sick of us, they kick us out and say, don't come back. Yeah, we have thrown to the pool house, we decided to pop up the podcast. You're in Atherton, I'm in the city in san Francisco, thank you. Duke of discretion. Is there anything else you'd like to tell them my address by gate code keiko out the fence. Um, you know, we had two guests on that, people just went absolutely crazy for the two days they weren't available. So we're just gonna talk about them. You know, we have two amazing David's in our lives. David friedberg and David sacks and they are super smart, super effective at their work.</mark>

            <mark>you know, and it's been great. Um, you know, we, you know, I think it's really kind of sad because where we're at as a tourist city that would normally be at peak season and it's just deserted right now. All the construction stopped. Normally, you see lots of, you know, hotels and houses being built and that's all stopped and there's no tourists. So it's always kind of cleared out. But I think it's quite safe. You know, every worker that I've seen here since we landed at the airport, you know, got transported to to the community were at, has been wearing a mask. Um, much more consistent than I think in the US and you know, I think it's been, it's been fine.</mark>

I was really excited for Um, Phase two of the shelter in place to uh start here in San Mateo County. So that's been really good. Um, a new poker table that I had built arrived today, which I'll be installing after this. And what I mean by I'll be installing, you'll be supervising, be supervising. You will be watching as people do really watching. And it's a beautiful table. I saw the pictures of additional infinity edge.</mark>

            <mark>That's a rhythm and you're, you kind of get kind of adjusted to it. So not having that. A lot of people I've been hearing are struggling with that. I was certainly struggling with it, having sleep issues. And I sit on about a dozen boards, some of which are small companies, some of which have a couple 100 employees. And I've been hearing pretty consistently mental health issues across all the companies. And I think it's just been really grating on people. I think it, number one kind of says we probably do need to be together and have social space as David said, like being in the same office, People really miss that and you get a lot of value from that. Um, and so I've been getting up every day in the last couple of weeks and going off site going out of my house to go work. We're actually working on another place and I have like a little office there and I go kind of work there. Um, and so that's made a huge impact honestly on my mental health, being able to do that every day. So just doing that's been helpful.</mark>

            <mark>Not everyone has that privilege, but I think it speaks a lot to why we're going to need to go back to offices when this is all about. And what do you think about what's happening with your business is obviously you're running a a startup studio, I guess would be one way to describe it where you create companies and then spin them out what's been the business interruption, if any, we have a couple of hardware and lab companies, that's most of what we've done. And so those operations are paused. So that's been really frustrating. The teams have all found ways to adjust and work from home. So our companies are not predominantly software based, there's a lot of software, but it's not predominantly software. So it's been difficult on those scientists and engineers that work in a lab or in a physical environment that they have to go to do their work. The larger companies, we have a number of food businesses that happen to be in the food supply chain. One way or another, frankly, those businesses are doing fantastically well. And there's been just this incredible success in the era of covid on kind of a focus on fundamentals like food supply chain, efficiency, availability of things that people need. And we were doing a lot in human health and we've kind of benefited from that. So yeah, I think there's kind of a mix for us that I think every business is bifurcated one way or another during this kind of moment of punctuated equilibrium.</mark>

            <mark>Yeah. I think one thing I'd like to sort of talk about is we had you both on the podcast early on at the start of the pandemic. And I'm curious um off now that we're here um over two months in quarantine sheltering in place and a lot of information, a lot of cards have turned over here, right. We've seen the flop. I think we haven't seen the turn in the river, so to speak. What is your assessment of what we were talking about, you know, a month or two ago and what we thought about this and what's become reality and what hasn't, what are you more optimistic about? What are you more pessimistic about? Let's start with you. I think that um we will have this pandemic or this disease well in hand, within two years. And so whether it's a combination of a therapeutic and vaccine or just a therapeutic, um I just think that we're gonna kick it sass. And so that's made me more optimistic. Um I think that the thing that's made me more pessimistic though is the return to normalcy has been sort of cut on political lines and it's been so massively politicized.</mark>

            <mark>I mean when David talks about the fact that, you know, you can go to a developing country like Mexico and all of a sudden, you know, everybody can get around the idea of masks. It's because there's a level of common sense there that trumps politics and uh, in the United States, that just isn't the case. And so what you're seeing in, in this crazy way, I think is sort of the center left and the left, uh, probably sticking very firmly to the ideology of sheltering in place and a lockdown probably on the sort of hope that it gets trump out of office. And on the other side, sort of the red states, I think I basically said, hey, I would rather get sick from coronavirus and take my chances Then 100% chance of failure that I have in my professional life, if you leave me at home for another week or month or what have you. Um, so that's been a huge disappointment of, of how political this whole thing has got and sacks. You've been talking about like common sense procedures, sort of, same question to you. What you first thought and you have been talking about, you thought an L shaped recovery. So we'll get into also the economy here. But in terms of the disease, what did you think two months ago that you don't think now and what do you think?</mark>

            <mark>Uh, well, in preparation for this, I kind of went through my twitter feed to see what, what I was saying the last time I was on the pod and how well it was holding up two months ago today, I tweeted that pandemic that under reaction caused the pandemic and overreaction will cause the depression and I think that's kind of where we are right now. We still have this pandemic with us, but now we're also potentially facing, I think a potential depression because of the way we're overreacting, we're still in lockdowns in, you know, huge swaths of the country. Um and no one can quite understand why, I mean, the original reason for the lockdowns was to buy us time so that the hospitals would become overwhelmed. Like italy well nowhere in the country to the hospitals get overwhelmed and we're still in these lockdowns and um and so, you know, I, I think that it's long overdue for for it to end now at the same time, you know, where I agree with tomato that this whole thing has become politicized where um you know, the people who generally want to get us out of lockdowns, I don't believe in doing anything. You know, they're not even a lot of them aren't even willing to wear masks, which I think it's just kind of insane. Um so you know, where I come out on this thing is that I think we should end lockdowns, but where mass and it's very hard to find anybody, you know, in the political spectrum who agrees with that because you know one side wants to keep lockdowns going indefinitely. The other doesn't want to store mass.</mark>

            <mark>And it makes no logical sense obviously. And if you think about our political system the left is so far left that the moderates on the left side don't have a place to live anymore. And then on the right the conservatives which I would put you in the group of who were um you know looking for fiscal conservatives, conservatives um they don't have a home anymore either. And so the most reasonable approach is clearly to start going back to work for people who are not at risk and who wear a mask.</mark>

            <mark>virus right? Yes exactly. As opposed to people whose case the problem with the it's kind of a debate between the the I. F. R. Versus the CFR the infection fatality rate versus the case fatality rate. The problem with kind of the official CFR numbers is that only the people who got really sick or you never got tested and um you know Freeburg was the earliest person. Um I know to start talking about the need for wide scale population testing and these blood serology tests and other kinds of tests to establish what the real baseline is. Um But regardless of like and there's been a whole bunch of different tests with different results. Um you know um we don't know exactly what the true I far is to this day but we do know it's probably closer to half a percent than 25%. So that's sort of Discovery number one I think Discovery number two is and we knew a little bit, we saw a little bit of this from the Wuhan data but now it's really clear that which populations are at risk and it's you know the data seems to suggest that people Under 60 who are healthy don't have sort of pre existing conditions are 50 times Um less likely to develop our there's a there's a 50 x greater chance for those over 60 In terms of uh of the you know, having a really bad outcome. Um and so for people under 60 who don't have these pre existing conditions it's you know it's just not.</mark>

            <mark>Yes there's always you know, examples to the contrary but it's not this this sort of gigantic risk. And so for two thirds of the population, they don't have a huge risk and we're still locking them down. Um I think the third thing, the third study, um not just study, there's there's been studies and there's been models and then we've also seen practice um is that wide scale use of mass sort of ubiquitous mass wearing um is sufficient to control the virus meaning to to stop the exponential reality of the virus we've seen, you know, in the asian countries or Czechoslovakia. Other places they've been able to get the, you know, the so called are not that the, you know, the viral coefficient to go below one with, you know, wide scale use of mass. And so we have a way to prevent the virus from growing exponential, that doesn't require lockdowns. And so the thing, you know, I I blogged about with the last time I was on your show is why would you do this most severe thing, these lockdowns and not do this easy thing. That's just merely inconvenient, which</mark>

            <mark>Freeburg when you look at it and you're the I think have the deepest science, clearly of the deepest science background of all of us. What what how do you look at this pandemic? Uh now that we're 75 days into it here in the bay area and obviously, you know, that started in december, It looks like in china, what's your take on it now. What did you get right early and what have you changed your mind about recently? Um I think I'm actually funny when you say that I just pulled up the original W. H. O. Joint mission on Covid final report and the date of this report by the way is february 20th. So there was this big thing, they published 40 pages long from the W. H. O. And in it they highlighted you know the fatality rate estimate inside of you be you know Wuhan and outside of CUBA.</mark>

            <mark>And they you know, we knew From this data very early on that we were at about a 1/2% fatality rate. And then you know, we saw all of this other stuff happened with Korea and the Princess cruise ship and the NBA players very early on we saw all these people that were roughly asymptomatic and we're starting to get to kind of explanations for why that is. But from the beginning I felt really like you know this is going to be a largely um asymptomatic kind of spreading uh infectious factor. What what I got wrong was when we went into lockdown, I don't know if you remember this when we talked the first time on Jason's on your podcast. I asked you guys or you guys asked me when I thought we'd be back and I was like zero April 7 will be back at work And I also had a bet going with you guys and I said we're gonna have less than 20,000 deaths in the us. I so overestimated the effectiveness of the lockdown and I think that was kind of, you know, one of the more kind of like striking things to me is the quote unquote lockdown and I just sent the video to nick, nick, do you have it? Can you keep it up? So basically this is what I think has happened in the United States, like pull this thing up. I was in Berkeley on saturday and I went to play to meet some buddies and we played frisbee golf on campus and had a beer, some college buddies of mine. And uh so I'm walking around in Berkeley and there is frat party after a frat party going on, no masks, everyone's on top of each other. You can see the video right here. I took a video and I think that's beer pong.</mark>

            <mark>Yeah, they're all playing beer pong, There's like girls and drinking and people are passing around bottles of vodka and there's no mask and this was the entire campus of Berkeley like and I think this is what's gone on like around the country. So the belief that you could just kind of like lock away the virus, I believe like, Oh my God, it's so extreme, it's so Draconian, we're gonna shut down the world and this thing is going to get stopped in 30 days, like happened in China, that is not what happened in the United States of America. Like people want to be free. People want to party, people want to live their life, they want to go to work, they want to see their friends and family and they are not used to being told no by the government. Um And so I think that's been to me, the biggest surprises just like how ineffective the quote unquote lockdown has been. And I think it really speaks to the need that David mentioned which is this lockdown isn't binary. You can't just say lock everyone down or let them all out. You've got a nuance your way to a solution which means like Masks, which means watching out for nursing homes, which means temperature checking before letting people in the buildings of over 100 people. Like all the stuff that I think needs to be done for this too. The kind of effective, you know, tracking and tracing and we can't just assume that, you know, a quote unquote lockdown is going to keep people inside and keep this thing from spreading because the frat party as you'll see is the perfect representation of what uh what's really going on out there. Alright, circling back around to you trim off, what do you think of what the two Davids sort of outlined there in terms of the path forward and how we all handicapped. What was going on.</mark>

            <mark>Well I think the reality is that bye. Um, hook or crook, we're gonna basically exit this lockdown sooner than we think because I think people just can't take it anymore. So there's no point in having a shelter in place order if everybody's running around playing beer pong. Um and so it's not doing anything. Um and so you might as well get the productive value of um the economy going again by letting people go back to work. Um, you know, we, we and just finding some simple ways that uh, people can look past the politics and just do the right thing. We're a goddamn mask and shut the fuk up and go back to work. Uh, it's really like, I mean, when you think about it, it's like, why is this such a big deal? Um, get everything you want and just put a little bit of cloth over your face. I mean, a lot of the folks that push back on this, um, you know, they're better off wearing the mask. Yeah, I mean, it is pretty striking when you watch the protest and you see a bunch of people who are, you know, obviously older and obviously those are not the best looking knives in the drawer.

            <mark>So so look here here here's the thing that we've had, we've had trillions of dollars of money printed into the system. And when you print that money into the system which the Federal Reserve has done, it hits the asset markets and it has basically stabilized the bond market. And the incremental dollar sits in the hands of an individual who must put the money to work. Because when you look back on this, this is not, you know uh A random person managing their 41K. The overwhelming majority of the money sits and sits in the hands of hedge funds or pension funds or sovereign wealth funds or mutual funds, they have a job to do. And so you have to think about what is their incremental decisions. So even if the stock market made no sense on any valuation metric, the incremental dollar that they have which they're paid to put to work will get put to work. And so what you've actually seen is a dispersion. And what I mean by that is if you graph The s. and p. 500 index um versus the unweighted S. And P.</mark>

            <mark>500 index, which basically means the first one ranks companies by market cap and gives the biggest companies moral weight. The other one ranks every company equally. There's been a massive split a dispersion. And what it really shows is that companies are traffic in bits. So software businesses have a bid and companies that traffic in atoms have gotten completely decimated and they are literally worthless. Um, and so when you put all these things, things together, the real economy is in the toilet. There are tens of millions of, you know, men and women out of work. Um, the earnings power of real companies that do physical things in the world are cheaper and lower than they've ever been. Meanwhile, the companies that have a high velocity, high margin software driven businesses have gone to the moon. So it's unfair to look at 30 or 40 businesses and paint that as a V-shaped recovery. It is a equity market that is buoyed by Fed dollars. That is not mapping to the reality of what's happening on the ground.</mark>

            <mark>Well, it kind of depends if there are other excuse to drop. So I agree with time off that, you know, the state of the economy right now is terrible and it's divorced from the financial markets because of, you know, all the money printing and interventions that the Fed and Treasury or have been doing. Um You know, one way to think about it is, well the stock markets denominated in us dollars and if, you know, they just printed a whole bunch more of them, those dollars are worth less. And so um you know, the price of the stocks are going to rise. Um But But yeah, I think looking forward um you know, I it's probably going to be a 2-3 year process to get out of this unless some other shoe drops, which could make it much worse.</mark>

            <mark>you know, and and by the way, the thing you have to remember is like look, the unemployment numbers that we have had in the last probably seven or eight years during Obama and trump have been completely manipulated because the number of people that are entirely leaving the workforce is quite high. And so, you know, it's not just a numerator problem. We have a denominator problem too. There are fewer and fewer workers that, you know, are willing to work because some of them just give up right or it's just not worth it for the pay that's available is another stadium. So the thing that we're gonna have to figure out is like how many of the people that are leaving the workforce may never come back and that has a societal toll and weight that we all have to bear. Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of people who maybe are in their sixties or maybe even late 50s, they got 10, 20 years left that they could be uh, working in management, sales, whatever it is. And they just say, you know what, it's not worth it. I'm going to go try to find a place to stay and maybe not rejoin the workforce early retirement or just capitulation. Yeah.</mark>

And so the, you know, the wave of defaults is just beginning and um, you know, who knows what happens with cities and states. Um, and so on down the line. I mean, who knows? You know, do the debt markets have kind of an inexhaustible um, you know, desire for to, you know, to buy us debt or could we reach some sort of saturation point? Um, and then that triggers the next, you know, set of, of crises. So we just, you know, I would say like that the 2 to 3 year outlook is, is the one that's kind of like what it looks like today.

            <mark>I think friedberg, we're all in agreement that there will be a second wave of some type. Just depends on how big the spike is. Do you think there'll be another new york city level outbreak where We'll see, you know, 2000 people, 1500 people dying in a certain region every day for some sustained period of time. What are the chance of that happening? Freeburg? I don't know. I mean, I think going forward the, you know, the new york situation, people's behavior have been shocked. So to the points earlier, the most effective thing you can do is stop coughing on your hand, touching a railing. Someone else touches the railing and touches their mouth. That's kind of how this goes. Um, you know, there's been early on some weird like a roast a list aerosolized studies that they kind of said, hey, this thing spreads in the air and so on. It's really, you know, you got to be in a closed kind of confined space.</mark>

            <mark>So people are wearing masks now. So the likelihood of the transmission happening at the rate that we saw in new york. Great paper out of MIT by the way, that shows how this happened on the subway. Um, really identified, identified the subway as kind of the primary vector that drove transmission in new york city. That was always my uh thesis. And I remember talking about and saying, how is this not obvious to everybody that eight million people ride that thing every day or something like it. So I didn't think they did an incredible job proving it. So it's not like people running in central park or spreading coronavirus to each other, Everyone in these confined spaces coughing in the air and then You kind of get this stuff and 20 people get on and off at every stop. That's the other thing people don't realize is that it's not just a bunch of people. It's not an airplane where you have X number of people going in one direction for 345 hours. This is 20 people getting on and off every five minutes. It's almost like you couldn't design a better incubator for it.</mark>

            <mark>And I don't think a city in the United States approaches the density that you have in new york. So remember these are not deterministic factors, there's, there's like a spectrum of probabilistic spectrum here. So you have a lot of people, they have a certain type of behavior, they're not wearing masks, you kinda add these up and you end up with this really high kind of vector that drives this uh, this rapid spread as we saw in new york city. You know, you're not going to see that in Dallas, you're going to see that in Houston, you're not gonna see that in san Diego. You're going to have more of the slow steady burn as some risk is taken in the environment. Some risk is taken by frat parties and people not wearing masks and people touching their mouth, but it's not going to have the same sort of massive effect we saw in new york. So I wouldn't expect us to have a new york style second wave. I do expect there to continue to be this like slow burn going forward of new cases and it's certainly going to be more obvious now that we're testing a lot more. And so treatment at this point, we're basically putting a price on life and saying, hey, some amount of deaths is worth taking the risk. And as americans, a unique group of people in the world and how we look at personal freedom, americans are just making the choice, Hey, listen, if you don't want to take the risk, stay home. But the rest of us, if we want to take the risk, we're going to take the risk. That's what this has come down to when your mind.</mark>

            <mark>Yeah, I think that it's very difficult for americans to um um envision a world where like, you know, their personal freedoms are infringed upon. I mean it's sort of like kind of one of the founding principles of the entire country. Um this is why I think that the tragedy of this thing is that the way to get everybody what they want is so simple. Um as David said, it's like, you know, above 65 you stay home, you work remotely under 65, you temperature check and wear a mask and you know, you're 95% of the way there, but it's become a left versus right decision to do it. You know, the mass squares are still in a lockdown and the non mask wearers want to get back to work and basically like there's, there's it's just, it's just another kind of culture war between the left and the right. Um it's it's really just shocking to me. I mean, I might for for for for what it's worth. You know, if I was, I am a betting man. So I'll just tell you, you know, my line now is that I think that donald trump is overwhelmingly likely to win as a function of people's frustration about the lockdowns and I think that the democrats best hope of winning in november is ending these things sooner rather than later. It's amazing. We're talking about a pandemic or once in 100 year pandemic it looks like and we're literally looking at our reaction to it through the lens of this president being reelected or not, literally, that's the determining factor on the advice we're giving to people. We're telling people they can't go to the beach, but they can be on an airplane, they can't go to the Tesla factory, but they can ride the subway.</mark>

            <mark>I mean, on a communication basis, is there any worse way we could have communicated this to the populist? Well, the communication was bad, but the I think the bigger problem, quite honestly is that the republican Democratic governors in the United States can't get on the same page and at the same time there's just a tendency to support donald trump or not support him in a very reflexive, instinctive way that isn't helpful right now. And uh, and there just doesn't seem to be enough political wherewithal and courage to just stand up and do the right thing independent of what you're what your political persuasion is. So, but but I think at on the margin now, I think you have different but very similar boundary conditions to 2016 where there are all these people that kind of like told you one thing and did another, they're all these people right now that probably are, you know, preference falsifying as we speak. And, you know, they'll show up into the voting booth and they'll be angry if they're not back in their jobs, Especially if they've been laid off by as as a result of not being able to get back and they would blame that on the democrats, not the republicans and therefore trump gets his next term. Well, because the it's the democratic states that are pushing the hardest basically. Like, you know, you saw the craziness in Los Angeles, but like you know eric Garcetti was basically like we will enter the shelter in place in, you know, december of 2022 it's like it's Los Angeles, it's not gonna happen, you know, players gotta play. I mean like this is just is unbelievable.</mark>

Yeah, so or Freeburg, maybe you take it Um we talked about that early on and that I think you properly said like if you took it earlier this could be you know uh it has potential taking it later. It's probably too late. I think you nailed that on the pod last time. Why has this become such a political issue? And what are your thoughts on that drug specifically and its potential efficacy? Look I'm not a doctor but it uh from what I understand um is there is uh so just so you know there's like side effects to this drug for a small percentage of the population. And uh this drug can actually inhibit um energy production in certain cells which can cause organs to dysfunction and particularly shows up in the heart. So people end up with what's called a long Q.

            <mark>So it's really a little bit of an unknown. There's also issues longer term with vision impairment can damage your retinal cells and cause vision loss. So there's risk to this drug it's not like taking you know an Advil. Um it is a it is a measured risk, it's a low probability but the severity can be high and so typically with a scenario like that doctors and scientists like to see you know phased clinical trials and you kind of do you know randomized and you have placebo and testing and so that hasn't necessarily been done for this particular virus, this particular condition. Um and often the design of those studies matters a lot. So you could give it to a bunch of quote unquote covid patients, but if it's not being given to covid patients either before or right as they're getting sick, maybe it doesn't show the results that you would expect from a prophylactic treatment meaning you're getting it before you're really sick. And that's where it may be the most efficacious. Um and so some people are saying, wait, we don't know enough, don't do it. It's not worth the risk because of that small percentage, high severity problem while others are saying, oh my gosh, it's totally worth the risk because the downside if you get coronavirus can be really bad and you know, so there's a lot of room for debate here and when there's a lot of room for debate, you usually kind of revert to some sort of base belief for some based kind of political point of view or something. And I think that's what's gone on here. This isn't a clear cut. The son is the is yellow and the sky is blue kind of conversation.</mark>

            <mark>This is like I can interpret this a lot of different ways. Um it does seem that like look this drug, you know like a lot of um has an effect in the same way that a lot of other that this drug might have on a lot of other viruses. Um and this especially plus zinc, you know and this Z pak Zithromax in which is an antibiotic together maybe really um effective and so yeah, if you weigh the downside and the probability of that downside for patient against what the potential upside would be depending on their risk factors now that we know those better for. Covid you can make an educated decision and maybe it should just be left in the hands of doctors versus like have some national statement about it. I don't know. But yeah, it's certainly a lot of room for debate and thus a lot of kind of you know political engagement on this Sachs is there was a lot of talk about what the bay area looks like after this, Whether it's commercial real estate with twitter and square going full work from home um and people not wanting to work in cities. What's your general thoughts on what the world looks like a year from now and maybe five years from now. If there is going to be some permanent change, what do you think it would be?</mark>

            <mark>the huge homeless problem, it's just, you know, public health issues with that. There's a lot of crime that isn't responding to properly. So there's all these reasons not to live there. But the reason why people chose to live there is because the tech industry had a very strong network effect and you needed to be in Silicon Valley or san Francisco in order to have access to these jobs and opportunities. And if those jobs opportunities are now available via zoom and you can be doing them from anywhere, are people still going to choose to live in SAn Francisco, you know, with and you know, with the the cost of living and housing and apartments and all the rest of that goes that goes along with it. So yeah, I mean, I think there is some chance that this whole remote work thing could break um Silicon Valley's network effect and that would be really bad for places like SAn Francisco which otherwise might not be the greatest places to live.</mark>

If you think just about Every manager now knows how to manage remote workers right? You learn that in like 34 weeks you figure out how to manage people remote even people who hated managing people remote all these gen xers and boomers who are managing you know millennials and earlier gen xers they now know how to do it and what they quickly learn is these three or four people in my team are crushing it.

            <mark>Then they're going to cut their office space. Now you've removed, I don't know call it 30% of the cost basis of the business, 40% of its operating better and people are happier. And then when you do hire somebody there's gonna be more talent available and you've just opened it up that you can hire somebody anywhere in the world without an office and you don't have to relocate them and you don't have to pay. I don't know what you guys think the average Additional cost is to be in San Francisco, but I'm gonna say $30,000. So a $40,000 a year job or $50,000 a year job becomes a 70 or 80, something like that. And if all that happens, these companies are gonna be so profitable that they're gonna start growing and that leads us out of the, um, economic downturn. Any thoughts on my, uh, my thesis? That's not a thesis. That's a hope. Yeah. Hope is not a funding strategy. Jason.</mark>

            <mark>Well, I just think it's a potential way out. I think, I mean, what do you think in general about this trend of remote then? I think it's great and I think that we're realizing that, um, you know, there's no monopoly on innovation and companies can be, uh, really productive remotely that most of the work in an office is busy work and politics and you can cut it all out and you can do, uh, the same amount of work in much less time, which gives you more time to frankly be with your family or take up a hobby or learn a second language or a third language. I mean, I just think it's so much better for people to realize like we gotta, you know, it's not like, you know, it's not, it's not 1820 or 1920, it's 2020. So we're going to live to 100 years old, like, we have a long time to be in the grind and so, um, you know, working and accomplishing what you used to in half the time and not having to commute and being able to live where you want and your people, you like, man, that has a huge positive impact to your kids, you, your community, it's just way better. I just think offices are just complete, kind of like, it's all Shakespearean theater in the end and cutting it all out is great. And specifically, san Francisco is just a complete cess pool dump of ship. And so, you know, being able to just get out of that city, All right, everybody welcome to the, you're listening to the college. I read some stats yesterday that were just so unbelievably shocking. Like the number of break ins, the number of uh, number one in the country, They're number one in the country. The amount of disease that, like, communicable disease, like typhoid and I'm like, typhoid, I I was born in a country and scratched and clawed to emigrate as a refugee to leave a country that had typhoid as a disease.

It was, that's what I paid 2007, I read, I read, I read a crazy article, it was about the Kushner's and this building that they own, that Brookfield asset management was going to buy and and it said that they bought this building and so the Kushner's moved to like Park Avenue, the General Motors building overlooking Central Park or something. Right, It's a beautiful building and it actually quoted in there the price that they were paying. It was incredible because it was like $100 a square foot per year. And I realized, oh my God, they're paying less for Central Park views in new york than I'm paying for a warehouse in Palo Alto, Fuck is going on. This makes no sense whatsoever. Yeah, that'll be supply and demand right there. Uh and I thought to myself like this is, this is crazy, like California is so expensive, the taxes are so high. Uh I think people are gonna leave in droves. Honestly, what do we think of Ellen um selling all his homes and then actually saying he's going to leave and you know, move Tesla out, I mean I don't think it's a practical reality to move Tesla out of California. I think that the incremental facilities can be built wherever he wants him to be built based on where he gets a tax incentives.</mark>

            <mark>Mhm yep, I think there's going to be some pretty significant benefits because the reaction you guys are speaking to, it's not just about people moving, but it's a reaction to regulation And that could have some pretty profound effect that could benefit certain sectors and businesses and accelerate new outcomes. One of the things that you know, I have a strong belief in is like I think in 20 years we could kind of eradicate all infectious disease. The only thing holding that up is regulation because the science is known, the engineering is basically there and it's simply a function of getting these things approved in getting across the finish line doing gene editing in humans for genetic mutations that cause harm to humans Is a technique that we've known for 20 years. And there was a guy, a patient that died 1999 from one of the first HIV treatments, the viral vector gene editing treatments. After that there was this clamp down and suddenly everything stopped and there was like no longer any progress in the space and they're just now starting to come back and there's a lot of um you know, really interesting technology that has been kind of hindered, I mean you know, not being able to put Tesla's out I think is the tip of the iceberg of what people are seeing, regulation can do to businesses. And um, look, I'm by no stretch, you know, libertarian party card carrier, but I do think, and I see it in business is that I'm involved in all the time, that this, you know, incredibly onerous, like overreaching regulatory burden and bureaucrats really hinder great new things from happening in the world. Um, and it's just become so friggin apparent how inept the people are that are making the decisions that are doing this to us our during this crisis. And I think it could have a profound benefit on kind of deregulation and accelerating the adoption of new tools and new technologies that could really help us all. Um, so I view the positive side of this, it's not just like everyone's going to leave California, like there's a net bureaucrats and overregulation everywhere. Let's talk to you politics for a moment to meth, you know, you heard the president called the Wuhan virus, obviously there's no doubt that it came from there. There is a debate was this something that was not created in a lab, but that was being studied in the lab and accidentally got out and that's how the jump happened. And there's some tension there between china and the us, What do you think the global reaction is going to be and the fallout will be for china, if any Japan is paying factories, I read, uh, helping subsidize them to move factories out of china so they can move that dependency.</mark>

            <mark>We always saw the dependency on PPE. And drugs being made actually in Wuhan in that area. And how we don't have a supply chain that we can rely on for really mission critical stuff. How do how do we look at this chinese relationship in the United States and globally post pandemic? This is the beginning of the modern Cold War. And so it's America versus china.

            <mark>R. Was at their peak. And the reason is because China has been making strategic investments for the last 30 years. Um You know, the biggest thing that prevents china from really going guns blazing broadside attack on the U. S. Is that the U. S. Dollar is still the reserve currency of the world. But even there china, you know, is trying to do a digital currency and a stable coin. And um these are all these state sponsored initiatives that come from frankly just strategic decision making to try to usurp the United States as the most powerful country in the world. Um and so again it goes back to is this a political issue or is this an ideological issue or is this an exceptionalism issue? Or is this just a practical reality that we do not want another country being number one And can we all agree?</mark>

            <mark>And if we can all agree, then I don't think they'll win. Where do you, where do you sit on it for you? Is it practical? Is it ideological, completely practical? I have zero. Like, you know, I I've been thinking about this a lot because I have not done any investments and I just did my first uh it's been three months and I did and it was a credit deal, so it's not even equity. Um and uh you know, I was and I was reflecting on what what am I trying to do Because I felt myself frenetically, you know, spending and working too much and you know, looking at all these different opportunities and I realized, wait a minute, like my job here is not to win some finite game, like this is not ending like a basketball game or a soccer match, this is like I'm trying to be in this thing for 50 years. So my goal is to survive. And the reason why I say that is my ideology is very fluid. I have to be able to adapt to market conditions as they change because if I want to be irrelevant, you know, person in the world in 50 years from now. First rule of business is don't go out of business. Second rule of businesses don't forget rule number one, you know, um so in that context, I think it's a very practical thing that we just have to deal with china and make sure that they do not usurp America's uh uh standing in the world as the most important country in the world.</mark>

Like I don't think you have the right to judge, just like California's can't judge Texans and Texans can't judge Floridians. Oh no you're wrong. You absolutely should judge people who are torturing people and not allowing people to have freedom of speech. Yeah you should judge them actually actually human rights violations.

            <mark>Just like uh J. B. Pritzker did in Chicago. I mean and I think the death penalty should be repealed too because we don't apply it properly. Those are the number one and two things probably the United States that go against the human rights, declaration of human rights and I'm actually very pro fixing those things. I was totally against waterboarding and I think that was the worst moment in modern american history. I honestly, I honestly think that like china is going to do china, you know India is going to be India and instead of getting caught up in our own ideology, um you should change it in your own country and then make sure that the other country doesn't win well. And that's my point is do do you believe engagement with china leads them towards democracy and better human rights conditions for their citizens or not? And I think the fool's errand that is an absolutely worked for east Berlin and and it did work in saving europe from the nazis, but the boundary conditions are entirely different and china has proven that it works, Europeans were genetically bred to be lazy oligarchs, they just needed okay, everybody, I think we just got kicked out of the itunes store. Saks, Ipu china, hawk dove engagement, isolation. Where do you stand? You heard thomas say his position?</mark>

            <mark>Yeah, decoupling from china is going to be a bipartisan issue now. Um I think both candidates now will be well, trump is going to is going to run blaming china for what happened and I don't think why it's gonna be defending china. Um In fact they're going to try and pick him with the whole Beijing biden label and he's probably going to try and trump trump on on china. So decoupling is going to happen. Um it doesn't really make sense for us to be dependent on china for our antibiotics for our medicines for our PPE for any of these um you know, I mean any of these products that are important for national survival, um I think all that stuff is going to come back home. Um I think you know, trading with them for other things might be toys, apparel things have to start fundamentally strategic the same way. I think that can continue. But you know, the thing about trade is it creates interdependence and I don't think that uh this country is going to be dependent on china for anything strategic anymore.</mark>

Uh obviously if they, you know, didn't they withheld information or silence whistleblowers, that's a whole different level. And then tick tock should be allowed to talk in this country. Uh should we, if we're not allowed to have facebook or twitter in china. Take those questions either or do you want?</mark>

            <mark>Well the on liability, I mean I think yeah their liability is huge. Um I mean there's still a bunch of questions we gotta answer around where exactly the virus came from. But the really fateful decision, but I think china made is when they shut down, travel to Wuhan to and from Wuhan uh you know with respect to other parts of china but they let people from Wuhan just kind of, you know, leave to go all over the world. And so you know they weren't letting people from Wuhan go to other parts of china but they were able to come to the U. S. And um so I think they do have a huge liability but are we going to hold them to it? No I mean as a practical matter um you know we're not gonna you know it'd be it'd be a mistake to to try and change the principle of sovereign immunity in the courts. But I think in terms of popular opinion they do have um</mark>

So you know for example the US is limiting and constraining Huawei's ability to get access to 5G. And so you know it really forces china to either by european and american equipment. Which is essentially to say that you know the Five eyes will be able to basically spy into china. Um or they have to basically you know uh storm into Taiwan and take over TSMC I mean so there are there are all these other gambits and strategies that one can take without getting ideology ideologically caught up in you know chinese human rights because they're not going to change.</mark>

And so it would be silly for us to say that we're just never going to have trade with china. But I think that trade also creates interdependence and so we're not going to, I don't think continue to engage to depend on them for things that would alter our national survival. And so, you know, that that's going to be the change. And the other thing is, you know, we're going to demand that the trade be more reciprocal.</mark>

            <mark>working. And, and that's the thing, at least we can like confront our hypocrisy. So Jason, I don't disagree with you about how, you know, gross the human rights record is I just think it's a joke that we all sort of like cry foul, like it's like the biggest thing in the world when we can't even clean up our own backyard and then meanwhile we continue to trade with them. That's just utterly utterly Yeah. So that's why I think we have to continue to work on cleaning our backyard while continuing to enable our own backyard. Meanwhile win the game against china and winning the game is not basically pushing for human rights reforms. It's making sure as David said, we have a better trade balance and make and making sure that like, you know that the critical parts of the supply chain and infrastructure that America needs for national security isn't dependent on a third party who have completely different incentives than we do. And then there's also like soft things like why is the, you know, why are we taking american movies and changing the ends in order to have them sold in china. Like they're literally corrupting our art and and that incremental dollar that Hollywood's getting or whichever, you know, person trading with china is getting. I think it's not worth giving up what makes America unique and a leader in the world. Freeburg, you have any thoughts on china, there's about 100 and 12 million people in china that work in factories factories in china are purpose built. So they're built to make a thing and then they gotta get retooled if you want to make another thing you take those two facts.</mark>

            <mark>It's very hard to kind of replace china as a source of production for a lot of what we consume in this country. That's the reality. So there's two ways you could go and then there's two kind of necessities and you end up with the matrix of like two by two you could decouple from china And um basically recreate that same production system here in the United States and that just wouldn't be possible. Like we don't have enough people to work, we don't have the ability to do that. The cost of everything would go up by 5X. We could invent new systems of production which we have the ability to three D. Printing, bio manufacturing. All these other kind of really interesting ways of making stuff that could replace the old factories that are run in china. Um Similar to kind of what maybe Elon has tried to do with his automated factory with Tesla and so through automation through three D. Printing through bio manufacturing you can kind of change the methods of doing this stuff. If we could do that then we could decouple from china. So the reality is like I don't know like how we continue to consume things at the you know it's a percentage of of wallet share that come from china without rebuilding how you make stuff.</mark>

            <mark>Uh No but that's the whole point by the way I think the reason why that's valuable is that that's the best way for us to actually get back to an inflationary cycle as well. So I completely agree with you it is incredibly inefficient, it'll be incredibly costly. But that's where I think you shift the balance of power so that instead of all the power sitting on the side of capitol you shifted to the side of labor, labor demands for wages and then all of a sudden costs go up, input costs go up, prices go up, inflation exists. And that fixes a lot of our debt problems. It fixes are deflationary. Supercycle, it fixes a lot of things. And so so if things got more expensive it would be good for Be very good. Yeah even but even look even with maximal like look that replaced 112 million workers in China with some number of Americans. Um you know I'm not sure you can make all the stuff you need to make here. Yeah I mean there's other countries too. I mean I think people are moving, fact Japanese are moving factories to Taiwan and Vietnam. Yeah but if we create new methods of production which we're uniquely positioned to do, we can completely reinvent the wheel and a lot of industries and I actually produce for the world right now you know china exports physical goods the U.</mark>

We have the ability to do that, we just got to get the funding will. So if I were to take $3 trillion of federal money and treasury bonds and hope that they don't turn into junk bonds. I would basically turn that money into reinventing the systems of like how do we make stuff using these new technologies that the U. S. Is uniquely positioned to capitalize on? And I love this one could make a could make the same thing that 100 Chinese workers make. There you go. I love it.

            <mark>but we haven't, we don't have any symptoms. I got tested twice negative both times. And it was a very weird thing because I think I'm Freeburg, correct me if I'm wrong, I would should be rooting that I had it and it didn't do anything to me. Right, totally. By the way, let me just say one more thing. That's a really interesting finding. Um, this paper came out a few days ago that shows that 40 to 60% of the population that has never been exposed to the coronavirus to. The current coronavirus already have activated T cells to the virus. And the reason is that they've had other corona viruses Through a common cold and they've developed this immune response. So this may explain why a large percentage of people are just so asymptomatic and totally fine. It's a pretty astounding finding. Um, and so you could get checked for those other antibodies or you know, these these activated T cells and know if you're in a good position to kind of ward off the coronavirus.</mark>

            <mark>And that's another thing we should probably do that 60% of people that already have this by the way that won't stop the spreading, that person will still get infected and spread. But there, you know, immune responses such that they'll shut the thing down pretty quickly. So would you call this like some parallel or shadow herd immunity or individual immunity? It's individual immunity and it's related to just cross reactivity with other corona viruses. So we've already developed an immune response to the coronavirus is that gives us seem seemingly a pretty good response to this coronavirus for more than half david population on a percentage basis. How um, how much do we know about this virus? Just as we wrap up here, If you had to state a percentage of like In two years we're going to know 100% or 90% about the virus, whatever it is. What do we know now? We know everything about the virus itself. We are very like, like with any virus, we know very little about how it affects a specific human based on their genotype meaning based on your health and your your jeans, here's what this virus is going to do to your body. And we're not going to know that in two years and we're not going to know that we don't know that for most viruses for humans today, the matching of genotype genotype of viral, but if we understand X amount about the HIV virus or Ebola, what do we know now? Maybe Ebola would be the best one.</mark>
