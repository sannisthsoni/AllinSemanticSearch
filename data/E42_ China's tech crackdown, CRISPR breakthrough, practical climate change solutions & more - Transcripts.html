            <mark>the other thing we predicted was, you know that this is going to be incredibly disruptive and it's going to create another debate of locked and potential lockdowns and mask mandates. And most of all we discussed and you know we had I think a pretty vibrant debate between all of us about under what circumstances does your decision to not get vaccinated impact? Everybody else vis a vis the Petri dish of the next variant that's coming. Hopefully that will be less deadly, less contagious, which tends to be how these things go. But we also predicted some people are just going to start requiring vaccines, vaccine cards.

They are not taking any of this vaccine. Hesitancy There's nine million people in that country. eight million are vaccinated. They're talking the last million. You gotta go get vaccinated.

            <mark>And for the last million of you haven't gotten vaccinated, if you want to attend any function with more than 100 people, if you want to go to synagogue, if you want to go to a sports game, if you want to go to the mall, you have to be vaccinated or you're going to get tested that day at your own expense. Um, everywhere you go, it's gonna be, so they're going to make it a real pain in the ass until you get vaccinated. You then separately had Roger Goodell basically doing the same thing in the NFL saying two players, you, first of all, all the coaches have to get vaccinated. There was an anti vax coach who got fired and then they don't have as much power as the players because the players have a union. But Goodell said to them, listen, if you don't get vaccinated, you're going to get tested every day that you go to work. And if the team, if there's an outbreak on the team and you guys miss a game, you're going to lose all of your salary, we're not gonna put up with. Apparently there's a game last year, during the, uh, during Covid, where Latinos, the Ravens, um, Steelers game and half of the one of those two things, the Ravens, half the first string was out with Covid or they were in isolation protocol because they're around players, you know, obviously, if you're in a locker room, one player gets, everyone's gonna be exposed, right? So it turned out to be like one of the worst games That the NFL put on last year and get all saying we're not going to put a product like that anymore. If you are the reason why the team misses a game, guess what? You and all of your teammates are going to lose your salary and this is only 17 games in the NFL season. You're</mark>

            <mark>I like what Danny Meyer did in this sense. He wants to create a certain experience for his clientele and he knows that his clientele are more likely to go dine in his restaurants. If there is a vaccine policy at his restaurants. He's not saying the policy for the whole country. He's setting it for his establishment. He has every right to be able to do that. And he believes that will help his bottom line and he's probably right about that similarly roger Goodell same thing. I mean he took a tough line because he knows that if he wants the NFL to put out a great product every week, they can't be canceling games because of Covid outbreaks. Uh, you know, they can't have the first string players out with Covid. So he made a smart business decision. I think people should have the freedom, the right to do that. Now I still have, let's call it a reservation about government requiring it.</mark>

            <mark>Um, not because I don't see the benefit, I definitely see the health benefit, but just because I don't like giving government the power to stick a stick a needle in your arm if you're a government employee, I do think the government has added power. We talked about this last week. They can make it a job requirement. And um, you know what's interesting in California California said if you're a state employee, you've got to get vaccinated. But the one group they singled out where the teachers because you know, Gavin Newsom has no guts to stand up the teachers union whatsoever. And I find it so ironic that early in the pandemic, we had this big debate about whether the teachers would go back to school in the fall and the teachers union said we won't go back unless we're first in line for the vaccine. Well, guess what they got that now they're saying, they're not going to go back if you make us get back. So, I mean, you can't win</mark>

There's one group that needs to do it most and they should be the one, it's kind of like the army and teachers and health care workers. They should be given a mandate. If you want this job, you must be vaccinated. You cannot be in the army in the military and not be vaccinated cause we need you in close quarters on a helicopter to go whack Osama bin laden can't have a covid outbreak in the navy seals.

            <mark>I'm okay with that. I think, I think every employer has the right to require it if they believe it's going to impact job performance. Now, I want to go back to the point that you made about the midterm elections. I, because there's a part I agree with it apart. I disagree with. So the part I agree with is that the republicans were cruising to, you know, a midterm shellacking and now, um, the whole vaccine hesitancy issue. I think there was a prospect of that causing damage that republicans, not because most republicans our vaccine hesitant, but rather because republican politicians were not out front enough on getting vaccines. But look, there's a difference between reality and perception. Here. Here's the reality. Every single republican governor, every single one has been vaccinated and has supported the vaccine mitch McConnell is vaccine sports vaccine, kevin McCarthy put out a statement. You even have the house minority whip Scalise get vaccinated on live tv.</mark>

But I think that it's going to have to require a little bit of back tracking and showing up, as you said by the mainstream republican political groups and they just have not done a good job. There's a really simple offering for them. New information, new strain, new approach. Listen, we didn't anticipate Delta would happen.

            <mark>even the CDC hasn't officially changed their policy yet. I mean, it's coming right. We know it's coming. They've always been behind the curve. We predicted the policy change on the show anywhere from two weeks to two months before they actually do it. But look on the vaccine, I don't discern a difference in position on the vaccine itself between Republican governors and democratic governors. They both are advocating it. They're both allowing private organizations to require it. But none of them to my knowledge have either had the guts or the temerity. However you want to see it to actually require it.</mark>

            <mark>And then on top of that all the educational companies this week we're told that they cannot operate as for profit companies and these companies have gone public in Hong kong and in the west uh and this has caused such an acute effects. Softbank Is clearing a bunch of its uber position to cover their losses. Indeedy a uh and then there is the story of Larry Chan who is a Chinese education entrepreneur, he was worth 15 billion in January. Now he's lost 99% of his net worth according to Bloomberg, he founded, go to Take the dough or tech Kiddo, which is a chinese online touring firm. As we know, education is huge uh, in china, That company go to peaked at $140 a share in January and has fallen to $3 a share, big sorted story there, 10 cent lost 100 billion in market cap in three days earlier this week as china crackdown on what they call the monopoly and music. Right? So while we debate what happens with the monopolies here in the United States china, just literally told them. And here's the quote from the BBC article, the company and its affiliated businesses have been told that they can no longer engage in exclusive deals over music rights and must dissolve any existing agreements within 30 days. I mean, this would be like biden, just saying the app store is now open, you have to let other app stores in apple or you know, just coming down and saying to amazon, you can't tell amazon basics anymore. In 30 days, no more amazon basics at the site, what are we, what do you think the endgame is here? Is this a because china seems like they are very deliberate and they plan in centuries, what is happening here, There's the short term and the long term, I think what's happening in the short term is that the same thing that we are talking about in the United States? That sax is you know, very eloquently, basically I think led most everybody in just really framing for a lot of people is this idea that um you know, we have privatized free speech and we have put The distribution of information into the hands of three or 4 founder Ceo oligarchs.</mark>

            <mark>That's also true in china and when you look under the hood of the major internet companies, there's four or five guys that are in charge. And so I think that in the United States politicians feel increasingly uneasy with those folks having power because it's applied indiscriminately trump gets banned, trump, may not get banned, this person get distribution. This article is considered misinformation. That article is considered disinformation. This article was suppressed. It's a dangerous place to be. Um and in china they were just like enough's enough. So I think the short term as it relates to the internet companies was basically a realization that we are not going to allow any more devolution of power from the chinese Communist Party to and into the hands of these internet entrepreneurs. So that was That was sort of like the it's a move out of fear, they're scared they're gonna lose their they're not scared, I think they're just smart and they were like we're not going to allow this to happen. So they don't have to deal with section 230 or any law like that. I think it was just a realization that we want them to understand who was boss, right? And so there was a wave of resignations, there was now all of this market cap upheaval and this is now when we get to sort of like the appetizer and I think in the appetizer, what they're basically saying is we will control how money is made and who makes money.</mark>

            <mark>And I think that that sets up the really difficult thing that I think happens, which is about the long term. So in this, in this thing, what's happening right now is china very firmly telling everybody we are firmly in control. There is no private market and there is no capital market without our approval. And that's a really big statement. Um and in fact it was such a big statement that I think the chinese uh security authorities and had like a conference call in Goldman Sachs, JP morgan. All these folks were invited and you know, the vice chairman, basically, his quote was something to the effect of, we promise that any more changes will at least let you know not a there's nothing nothing to see here or there's nothing more to come. It's just more that as we decide new rules will make sure that we give you guys enough warning. So it's very much firmly saying we know exactly how money is made, we will decide who makes money in what way and we're going to make sure that, you know, all of this wealth creation happens under terms that we define. And I think that the setup for the long term, The long term in China is complicated. It is an enormous demographic time bomb. We've talked about this before by the end of 2100 China's population will shrink from 1.11.2 billion people down to about 700 million people. Right?</mark>

There was such a number of people, those people were able to get great jobs in the, you know, eighties and nineties and two thousands and now they've realized, wow, we made a huge miscalculation because now there's just not enough people and so china is going to shrink. And I think that honestly, I think she Jinping probably thinks the simplest way to solve this is to basically nationalize a lot of the economy over time. And so I if I was a betting man, which I am general, but I'm not in china because I just don't understand the market. It's super comfortable casino. It's a stupid place to bet, I'm not going to say that I just think that I don't know the market. Well, I think that they changed the rules of the game. Hold on, let me just finish what I'm saying. I think that what we're, what we're starting to see is the beginning of nationalizations and I think it's going to start in technology universe because those are the critical assets that the chinese need to own for the future. So that's, in my opinion, what's happening? I think it's really important what's going on there. Um, and uh, sacks.</mark>

            <mark>if they go that far. I think it's really interesting actually to compare what's happening in china with what's happening on the U. S. In the US. Because on the surface both countries or having this debate about whether big tech needs to be reined in broken up controlled. We're having that debate in the US and obviously they're having some version of it in china, but it's a little bit like the civil rights debate right? Where, you know, we have our civil rights issue in the US and you know, they have Shenzen, you know, they have the ***. You know, it's like a whole order of magnitude different in terms of the way they react. And I think there's I would say there's three main differences here between the chinese approach and the U. S. Approach. Number one, data privacy.</mark>

            <mark>We have a concept of separation between private companies and the data they control and the data that the U. S. Government can get its hands on and the U. S. Government typically has to get a warrant and go through a corporate seem to get that data, what China is doing. They have not passed a law basically saying all these companies, your data belongs to us if we want it, we get it, they're taking operational control over the data and you know, they're going to use it. Okay. That's a big difference. Number two, I think that China seems to be really worried about these big tech companies, not just in terms of whether they might engage in anti competitive practices or consumer harm, sort of those conventional antitrust concepts in the United States, but they're concerned about these big tech moguls becoming power centers in China. And you saw this with Jack Ma, right? I mean clearly the CCP had a problem with the way that Jack Ma had become a figure that people rallied around him, they looked to him, they cared about what he had to say and all of a sudden yes the anti pope was put on hold but it was more than that right? Um You know this was not just like you know what the sec would have done all of a sudden Jack Ma disappears, he goes into some sort of house arrest.</mark>

I don't think the guy should be under house arrest if he wants to donate his money to political causes and speak out as a private citizen, he has every right to do that and I'll defend his right to do that no matter you know how much I want you know apple to be reined in that. They don't have that. Again. That separate concept in china. And I think the last thing that's going on here that's different is you saw china put the Kabash on, there are 34 I. P. O. S.

            <mark>evaluation. That's a would you would you agree with me that the decoupling of these financial markets might be in the best interest of humanity and ultimately the decoupling of these two economies. If we don't see eye to eye about human rights and how to treat people, maybe it's good that we have a little more distance between the two markets. I mean it's hard to know if engagement is the better process. But it doesn't seem like the chinese Communist Party wants to have anything to do with democracy, anything to do with free markets, They want to control all the markets.</mark>

            <mark>Yeah I mean you could see but you know in a way the product that the US was exporting to china was was our financial markets and and I think a good way. Right? So I think the bad version of this is when china is able to buy up ownership in critical strategic centers in the U. S. And that affects people's speech rights over here. But this is not china buying up ownership in the US, this was china acting as a consumer of U. S. Financial markets. And um and I think I think it's different right, when we're selling products over there that helps correct our trade balance right? This is why I don't have a problem with the L on selling cars over in china is he's helping our trade balance. Okay. But so but they're kind of canceling that they're kind of saying we're going to reassure this industry will want to have a domestic, you know, this is this is it</mark>

            <mark>this is creating a mono economy, right? It's like it's going to blur the lines between public and private ownership and it's going to basically make it one huge pot from which the chinese government um can can take and put it back into as it deems fit for the broader success of china as a whole, right? So if you're a ceo and they don't like you you're going to resign right? If you're a company and they're worried about your propensity to be a little too frisky on your own. They'll reign you in. I've allowed to use cyber security law or something else. But the point is that I think that we shouldn't take this as free market regulators having their way. This isn't lina khan implementing, you know, some laws, this is a top down decision to nationalize large parts of the economy, starting with technology. And I know that for some people that may seem unfathomable, but if I'm a betting man, which I am, that's what I would bet on that. This is the beginning of the beginning of an attempt to pull these companies in. I mean what David said is true, the chinese government owns the data of chinese companies. So at the end of the day, the chinese government also owns the users and it also owns the revenues.</mark>

            <mark>It just hasn't told you yet in a way, it's like the chinese government in our our government is trying to officiate the game fairly and create a really competitive, vibrant game. And I think the chinese government just said as the game's over like there is no game, there's a game, it just has, it just has the game because it has an Uber Ceo, it made a bunch of Ceos general managers in a large corporation that report through a reporting chain to one person, she Jinping. But there's no more game in terms of building companies and investing in china, how is the West ever going to trust? How is Goldman Sachs or Sequoia? You know, launching a venture firm there or retail investors or hedge fund investors, how are they ever going to want to participate in that market because so look for example, when you invest in china right? Or if you set up a fund, you know, there are two pools of capital right? There is the local, remember denominated investment vehicles and then there's the U. S. Dollar denominated investment vehicles and they do that to segregate where the capital comes from. So it's not too difficult for the chinese government to basically say, you know what, I'm going to actually make A constraint on dollar inflows so that you know the renminbi denominated investment funds that are from Chinese investors into Chinese companies needs to be above a certain percentage. Call it two thirds right? Or call it 80% they can make all these decisions because these are all just rules that are completely under the control.</mark>

            <mark>So I I think that people who don't think this is going to happen are probably not looking at the setup, The setup seems to be directing itself towards that outcome and by the way it makes sense for what Jinping wants to do from. But that's not my question. My question is why would Masayoshi San or another entity ever invest in china? Because you look through the risks and you got completely enamored by the population of the tam. But what I'm saying now is why would they do it again or are they not going to do it? No, but there are there are boundary conditions that would say that even before this, you would have had to reconsider the population is shrinking. There's a different demand side pull that's happening right? Older people need different kinds of services than younger people. There's not enough younger people, there's too many men, there's not enough women. So there's not enough couples. There's not all of these demographic issues ultimately will get reflected in the economic reality, which is that smart investors would put money in china differently over time anyways. But I think that this is a bigger thing as David said, which is if that's coming to pass, you want to control the pipes because you want to control how that information is presented to people, your citizens so that they don't get pissed off and then you might as well just own the economy, they own the business anyway.</mark>

            <mark>So this is being amazing for american tech companies because I don't see who would ever want to be an entrepreneur, whoever has a great idea and wants to pursue it in china. I just want you to do it. No, I disagree with you. And and and the reason I distributed, we don't have access to their markets anyway. What company has access to their market? The difference is young smart chinese people for decades have been staying in china in part because it was more, they could more relate culturally to Jack Ma than they could to Jack Dorsey. Okay, that's just I mean that just makes sense like and I understand that and then the second is we like a lot of like, sorry, like the opposite of some other western countries that Canada closed our doors, why would the next Jack Ma start a company if they saw Jack Ma Shortly? That's my baby. Because you know what if you're coming from China and you can, you can only make a billion versus 45 billion. I think you still take the shot. Okay.</mark>

            <mark>Absolutely. I mean look, I think what President she is doing is fundamentally redefining the bargain between chinese entrepreneurs and the government And here here was the original bargain, right? The great chinese leader and economic reformer. Deng xiaoping basically set the bargain 40 years ago and basically the bargain was this, we're going to open up the economy and let you the entrepreneur get rich, we're going to keep all the political power. So as long as you don't mess with us politically, you can get as rich as you want. That was the original bargain. Now, President G. Is saying there's a new bargain, there's a new boss in town and here is the deal that economic interests in china will be subordinate to national interests. Those national interests are defined by the CCP and I run the CCP</mark>

Because basically in Russia, they were just killing people and taking their businesses. I mean, this feels like the equivalent in china. He Magnitsky.

All the chinese feel very active in the United States investing in companies. All the chinese Lps are are fine. All the chinese Gps or find all the chinese companies are fine. I think David's right. It's just a discount factor. I do think it affects global dollar flows. And I think it's hard for uh western capital pool to allocate money to china without doing a little bit more work and applying a higher discount.</mark>

It has to be are we living on borrowed time? How much more time do we have before china says that chinese profits, chinese return on investment are going to go to chinese individuals and companies under our control because that's the direction it all seems to be headed.</mark>

            <mark>So you know, china can't force a shareholder of DD to sell the shares because it's listed in american stock exchange. But they, but if D. D. Does go private the way that you know the news reports are saying somebody's going to have to backstop that capital, I suspect it will be a chinese organization so they will take deedee private again and then buy out all of the shareholders who bought from around, by the way, if that does come to pass. I think that is the, that is an obvious signal that we're moving into sort of a more the nationalization of critical resources and china has determined that internet resources are critical and I think that that's right. If I was in their shoes, that's exactly what I would do as well. Does this mean that we should be kicking out chinese companies from operating in the U. S. I. Tiktok etcetera. You know, But I do think that Tiktok needs to get carved out of bite dance and it needs to have a completely american cap table. But that shouldn't be a government edict.</mark>

            <mark>Crazy. I think I think there's a few things for us to worry about their um I I like the idea about competing china by having freer and more open capital markets and allowing anyone in the world to invest in our companies. I think the issues with Tiktok are more around data. You know we know now that any data that by dance has belongs to the chinese government. This isn't just a tick tock issue. It's any company, any U. S. Company that's doing business in china. Look it applies to zoom. Okay look zoom in zoom Right now. Zoom is not a chinese company but it has a giant engineering team in china. What are the data implications for that?</mark>

            <mark>They stopped routing their service to remember? They had some servers routing through china but I do think they're going to have to shut down and sell off whatever their assets are in china. That's going to be untenable to have a communication platform. You know, it's kind of like wow right we don't allow way to operate and we're gonna have to do that with software right? There's been a big CRISPR breakthrough 65 year old man named Patrick Dougherty was suffering with a disease in which his protein was miss shaped misshapen building up in his body destroying important tissues such as nervous his hands and feet. He watched the same disease kill his dad and here's the quote had watched others get crippled and die difficult deaths from this disease and it's a terrible prognosis. He entered a trial utilizing CRISPR gene editing tool and researchers reported the data indicating that the experiment treatment worked well. The study darty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene editor directly into patients and letting you find its own way to the right gene in the right sales. In this case the cells in the liver making the destructive protein. The advance is being held not just as not just for aimee Lloyd doses patients but also as a proof of concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other much more common diseases. The new way of using innovative technology to my thoughts, I think this is a really important breakthrough and what it allows us to do now is see a world where look if you if you think about The two different paths of the following idea, you're going to make a solution to a problem. If if the problem was an internet company or you wanted to make a product, what you would do is you would go to amazon web services, you'd be able to consume a whole set of abstractions and then you would build a light amount of programming which is essentially like the application logic of your app, right?</mark>

            <mark>I think a lot of people listening understand that idea because that's what they do here. What we're getting to a place is now soon we're going to be able to view biological problems in the same way. So we're building all these small, little building, I don't want to call them small, but building these very important building blocks that is very much akin to the building blocks we needed to put together the first set of computers to put together a mess. Does all of that allowed us to create Windows? Windows allowed us to actually access the internet. And there was this in serie autumn development of things that happened and I think that we're on the verge of that and that's what these kinds of breakthroughs really show us, which is that you can view. So for example, you know, in a different company, um, they created these M RNA Gatorade's logic gate arrays. So if you're, you know, a chip designer, you would understand how to basically create electrical function in part using, you know, get a raise. But if you reduce a biological function to the same idea now that same person has a translational ability to solve a different problem that they didn't have before. So I think what we're saying is that we're seeing this platform ization, this aWS ification of a biological toolchain with things like CRISPR and all of the other modalities that need to stack on top of it so that the next person can view it as a programming problem. And I think that that's a really exciting path that accelerates a lot of this development. But this is an enormously important breakthrough because it validated a lot of CRISPR was beyond a lot of theoretical innovation that that up until now was basically what it was known for.</mark>

Yeah, and related related news, CRISPR creates its first genetically modified marsupials. After years of using the gene editing technique CRISPR to genetically modify everything from vegetables to lab rodents, researchers have used it to edit one of the hardest targets. Yes, marsupials, the MIT technology reports, I guess it turns out they're very hard to edit and we're now at any more studios and changing things like their hair color. So brave. New world.

            <mark>pretty incredible. Just one thing to add to that. I mean, I think what it shows is that these Covid vaccines are just the first product, the first breakthrough product of this MRNA technology, there's going to be a lot more and what I wonder about is you know this this category of vaccine hesitant people. They're kind of like you know in the in the technology world you have kind of a spectrum of early adopters, late adopters, blood icts, people are actively against technology. Yeah.

            <mark>it's even more violently opposed. I think the original luddites um they think the original luddites were in England. They lost their jobs at some factory and so they've broken the factory with sledgehammers to destroy all the machines that replaced their jobs. So there's clearly a spectrum and what I wonder about is that if you're on the low end of the spectrum with respect to biotechnology, I mean are you going to have a materially worse life because you're not getting the benefits of all these vaccines and all these treatments? And I mean Kobe could just be the first example of this.</mark>

I mean We could we could genetically modify people to stay underwater for 10 minutes and be you know better processors of oxygen Like other mammals are You could have superhumans. I mean that's basically where this is going and that unlocks a whole another level of ethical and moral considerations. But you're right.

            <mark>Jason. Be honest. If you could actually increase anything in your body through this gene editing what would it be? Just throw anything out there. But the first thing that they got their anything they increase my muscle mass. 100% increase my muscle mass. And there was a percentage of fat would go down. not in reality in absolute terms, but just in percentages. So this crispy thing was a public company called Antonio therapeutics. Um, but I want to throw a shout out to another startup that seemingly I think may have had a breakthrough this week called Form Energy. And the reason why these guys are interesting is that they've built this incredibly massive long duration battery out of iron. Now, why is that important?</mark>

            <mark>We have really simple ways of harvesting iron from the earth. It is literally everywhere, everywhere you look, iron exists. It's not so true for nickel. It's not true for cobalt, it's not true for manganese, it's not true for lithium, it's not true for all of these other specialty chemicals that we need in order to build batteries. But these guys have solved a very complicated technical challenge that will allow you to store energy cheaply, which has huge implications for electricity and grids. And so big shout out to these guys that form because if if it looks like what they said, they did is true. It's a really important breakthrough that will have some important ramifications. It's amazing by the way to see progress. Now you wake up and you read these things and you're just like God, this is incredible that there are people working away on shit that really matters. It's almost as if there's like one group of, we talked about cynicism in a previous episode recently, there's one group of people whether you're in the founder circles or capital allocator or a journalist covering the space who understands it, there is a technical, you know, explosion going on here and innovation that is going to solve a lot of problems.

            <mark>And there's another group people who feel like it's over and don't have kids because the whole planet is gonna go on. I mean, I think Ellen tweeted this out and I think we've talked about this now with respect to china, but you know, we have an enormous problem in the world in general, which is that unless our birth rate is positive and creative, um it has huge implications to progress, right? If you just like if you eliminate or you decrease the denominator of the global population, the odds that there's another Elon musk or Jeff Bezos that are created or just lower and so net of anything else, a declining population rate, particularly in Western countries has huge detrimental effects to the world. And so all the folks that think that they're going to solve the ecology of the world by not having kids is a little misguided. The thing to do is to actually have a positive birth rate, find technological solutions to this problem and allow what we've been able to do, which is a rising populist to basically be motivated to work and solve problems. And I think that we have to be very careful about that because if, if people don't get this right, they're going to take the wrong solution, it's not going to be a solution is at all and it's going to make the problems even worse. Could you imagine if the population of the earth shrank in half what it would mean in terms of productivity services, the health care requirements that are needed, the cost of providing those things, the economic viability of countries will go away, it would be a disaster. Yet there is a group of people who feel we should do exactly that and not a small group of people. Well</mark>

            <mark>they think that I think, I think the mistake isn't thinking that human consumption is the problem. Um and specifically with respect to climate change or global warming No, you you can't see it that way because um look, humans in order to exist, need to consume and we're going to emit carbon as part of that process. The important thing to focus on is energy production. Are you shifting to clean production not because you're never going to shrink your consumption enough to to basically eliminate carbon emissions. Um it has to be done on the production side. And one of the interesting things that's happening now, um, I think we should talk about is in europe, they're creating this new carbon trading plan. I think China is even trying to set up one of these markets and so they're creating these new, um, you know, marketplaces to trade carbon permits. And I think the most exciting part about this is that it gives an incentive for innovators to create new technologies that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere. They're called negative emissions technologies. Because what happens is if you have a technology to take carbon out of the atmosphere, you can now sell a permit on the exchange that gives somebody else the right to admit that carbon and now those technologies, those, those those nets, the negative emission technologies, it's unclear whether they really exist yet, but no one's going to create them if there's not a customer for them. And that's what's really cool about these new tradable permit schemes, is they create a buyer for, for those nets. And I think that's ultimately how we're going to solve this problem of climate change.</mark>

            <mark>Yeah, let me just build on that for a second. There's, look, there's a bunch of cap and trade systems china basically has a terror, uh, a carbon tax system in place. The big thing that none of these folks have gotten to yet. But I think if you look at the laws in europe, they're going, there is the idea of a carbon tariff and I think these carbon taxes, if they actually exist properly, will look like a tariff. What does that mean? Let's just say your Britain and you want to import a Volkswagen from Germany. If Britain has a carbon tariff that says basically, you need to account for all of the emissions that went into making this car and I'm going to assess an import duty that basically maps to that. Um, I think that that's where the world is going and that's probably David to, to your point, it's going to be a really big value unlocked because the amount of money that will get both made but also destroyed in that process will be incredible. And that's where we have a chance to really reimagine consumption in a different way. Like there are just so many categories. I saw this interesting stat if you look at CPG companies right, companies like Procter and Gamble Clorox and you compare them to the places where they sell their goods like walmart and target Every single major big box retailer has basically declared a net zero emissions strategy in the next 5-10 years. Not a single company on the CPG side has actually any plans to do anything meaningful, Anywhere Near 2030, 2045, 2050.</mark>

            <mark>And when you look under the hood, those companies like P and G and Clorox are enormous, emitters enormous. So even though you walk into a target and amazon and you try to make yourself feel good thinking, thinking to yourself on buying something that's zero emissions, it's not true. It's basically that amazon will will bear the cost of getting to net zero but the products that you actually consume are horrible for the environment and the amount of you know, um fossil fuels that went into it and the amount of plastic that will then get put into the ocean, it's tremendous. And so moving slightly more aggressively beyond these cap and trade systems into something that looks more like a tariff I think could be really important for the world and we're going to need to do it. There's and there are multiple ways to do it. I don't know if you guys saw Ellen backed the X prize carbon sequestration sequestration Project which is a $100 million dollar prize and you can do this in multiple ways, you can do it at the factory and there's the one trillion trees dot org and if you saw that where they're trying to plant a trillion trees because that's the original way to sequester this carbon, so there's going to be like three or four different ways to do this. And if there's an incentive to do it, Yeah, that is going to help for sure.</mark>

            <mark>Part of why there's such political discriminate over this is because you look at approaches like the Green New deal. I mean, I think they understand the problem, but what they're proposing is always on the consumption side is basically politicians picking and choosing how people are going to consume carbon, whether it's cracking down on private planes to factories. I mean, again, taking us back to the Stone Age, um, nobody wants to know, no one's saying, I think wants to support that kind of totalitarian principle that the politicians get to tell us how to consume. But this is this is why I think these these market based solutions where you say, look, carbon emissions are obviously an externality. If you want to admit you need to basically pay the correct price for carbon emissions and we use the money that you pay as as as some sort of, um whether it's a tax or whether it's buying a permit, we use that money then offset into negative carbon emissions. It's a market based system where the government controls the externality, but they don't dictate how people get to consume carbon. And I think that's the right balance. And we don't really have that type of balanced conversation in the US yet, because You've kind of got one side that says they want to save the planet, but they want to control everything. And then you got the other side saying, well look, I want to save the economy because your plan, the green new deal is going to destroy it. What we need is is again a market based solution to this.</mark>

            <mark>And I guess the criticism of a market based solution is you're basically giving people a way to a the most cynical interpretation would be you can pay to pollute, You can just, you can pollute all you want and just pay a fine essentially. But that's not the right way to look at it. You're actually offsetting somebody else's capturing what you put out there and it depending on the rules of the road, if you had to capture 50% more than you put in, you could create a formula there, right? I mean, there could be some formula that over time there's been a lot of fraud in this market. Like, you know, people sell these carbon credits from, you know, Certain forests and there's this joke which is like there's been a tree that's been sold like 80 billion times because it's like, you can't really verify, you can only really estimate the amount of carbon sequestration that, you know, for example, a tree actually does in the first place. And so there's been just a lot of unfortunately, you know, fly by night unreliable, non trustworthy ways that this market has evolved. People have been waiting for decades for this carbon trading market to really step into high gear, which is why some folks think the more aggressive plan will just be introduced tariffs and let the market David to your point sorted out,</mark>

            <mark>I do think that we are a couple of breakthroughs away from these things being non issues. So I'll give you a couple of examples if you look at like, I'll just use batteries as an example because where I'm spending a lot of time when you look back and like you ask yourself like how did we decide to make the batteries the way we make them? Um, you know, was it some like, you know, broad survey of every single chemical composition and all these different structures and we realized that, you know, a composition of nickel and manganese and cobalt was the right thing to do or lithium and iron and phosphate, was it turned out that it was mostly like a handful of people decided and we all just been iterating around the edges ever since. So one of the solutions to a lot of these problems is to actually go back to first principles. The problem is that as these industries get built up and you know this you have so much um pp any like so much equipment, so much investment in physical Capex that's happened. The idea of switching platforms is almost impossible because it's not economically viable. So we are in this situation today where a bunch of solutions have been proposed, David to solve that problem. Right. The problem with carbon capture and other other things and negative emission technologies is that they're extremely expensive. They're very inefficient. They require an enormous amount of energy themselves and it's not clear that they work. So what's happening one is that there's been some pretty novel innovations in moving people past some of these basic problems by looking at the periodic table to try to find different ways of solving things like energy storage, which has huge implications to climate.</mark>

            <mark>But the second is that we are pushing the boundaries of physics in different ways as well. And that's where there's going to be the potential for an enormous breakthrough specifically around superconductors. So what is a superconductor, it's something that allows an enormous amount of energy to basically trans through it. Now we have this issue which is that you can actually create superconductors in highly controlled environments that are extremely, extremely cold but they have incredible performance characteristics that would revolutionize power and energy transmission and storage people have been innovating in bringing that up to room temperature In that breakthrough, which I think you will see in the next 20-30 years it's just a complete sea change of how we think about this whole problem. So I think the short term we're innovating in the periodic table in the long term we're figuring out how to bend the laws of physics. And I think that those are, those are probably the two most practical solutions to a lot of these things that remove the constraints that we've created. And again the constraints have been completely human defined, which is the sad thing, they were not necessary from the start. We could have made very different decisions had we known these problems, we're going to be as big as they were. You know the way that we make plastic didn't have to be this way, write the amount of petroleum that we use it. It didn't have to be in this specific way. But this is where we are. And there are direct air capture technologies.</mark>

            <mark>Dak which is basically an energy issue, you can literally suck the carbon dioxide out of the air. Um And again, another, another issue of material science because the substrates that you used to be relatively inefficient and sort of really activate them. You're pumping a tremendous amount of energy through there. That's the issue is can you get the energy and I think when we talked about the small reactors, the small module or nuclear actors if energy is free where its solar based you could you could kind of get a virtuous cycle going here. That's essentially what superconductors allows you to see as a world where you basically have limitless free energy.</mark>

            <mark>It sounds like the thing that we all agree on is that this problem is ultimately be solved by innovation. And this is the problem I have with so many of the political proposals is our ability to innovate is a function of the size and scope of our economy and the incentives and rewards for innovation and the freedom for entrepreneurs to do their thing. And if you crush that, you know with government mandates you won't get the innovation. We need to get out of this problem.</mark>

            <mark>We can easily innovate our way out of it. And it requires some individual to say I want to dedicate my life to it. And then what is the motivation to do that? And who are the capital alligators, who are going to give them the billion dollars to create this. Cos I spent a bunch of times so I'm the capital allocator. That will give billions. In fact I did a survey of the superconductors case as an example and here's what I found of the of the four folks that I found who are all each individually doing things in superconductors that I think are incredible. They're all immigrants, Every single one were not born in the United States, you could, you, they are so fucking happy to be here. They feel so lucky and they don't understand why everybody complains all the fucking time. Yeah, complaining is there is a disease of constantly complaining about stuff. And if you count the number of times you complain every day and it's more than two or three times a day, you need to get your head examined. You're probably just talking yourself into anxiety problems, Stop complaining, Start building these problems are solvable.</mark>

And what's interesting, David to your point is he had a four year period where he took a huge step back where basically like you know, he had this superconductor, he's like it works at, you know, I'm just gonna use simple numbers here, but like you know minus 300 Celsius when he got it all the way up to minus you know, 100 then it went back to minus 200 for four years. Could you imagine the mental devastation? And I said how did you deal with it goes? You know, basically he's like, oh it's nothing. Yeah and thank God for that guy. It's interesting. I just listened to Quentin Tarantino's on a podcasting tour because he's got a new book. He wrote a novel out of the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood characters and I just started listening to it. It's fantastic. Listen, inaudible. And uh brian Koppelman from the moment interviewed Quinton.</mark>

Natural born killers. And he was just talking about how the first movie nobody would do. Then he wrote to two screenplays and nobody would do and then he got to Reservoir Dogs and You know they tried to scrape together $800,000. And he kept asking like why didn't you quit? Why don't you quit? He said well you know I just, I figured it out like I figured out I had a voice and then nobody would buy my scripts because I was trying to do something innovative and they were reading the scripts and they didn't understand what I was doing in terms of innovating on how a movie would be with, you know how he does with pulp fiction. He changes the time and tells the story telling in a non linear fashion. He said nobody understood it, but every time I read it I realized I had a voice, it was my voice, it was getting better and better. And then people, you know I sold those movies and then he kept building them and it was very inspiring to think about that take of like he just didn't give up and he just looked at the work and he found his, he found his own value in his own work improving.

            <mark>a it's a fantastic story. It's like one of those classic, you know Hollywood entrepreneur stories, he's working at a video store for years and you know, he would start, he was making his own movie and he would film on the weekends and then, you know, he, he made a few $100 every week basically and then he would rent the equipment on a friday because then they would only charge him for one day because it was the weekend. So he could basically record the entire weekend. And so he would go off and record and, and then you have to go back to work and he started making this movie, you know, one weekend at a time for like two or three years. And then he finally put, he didn't even have the money to get the film developed. So finally after three years he gets the film developed and unfortunately it sucked, it wasn't what he was expecting, but during that time, uh, he wrote term ants, which then got bought, he sold that screenplay that gave him a little bit of money, then he wrote Reservoir Dogs and then he met Lawrence Bender and you know, vendor went out, read the script was like, holy shit, this amazing, they raised the million or so bucks to make the movie and then that kind of launched everything. And yeah, it's, it's one of these, you know, amazing rags to riches stories. Um, you know, they're kind of rare and they're more rare in Hollywood, they occur all the time in the tech industry,</mark>

But I think in the bret Easton Ellis in the joe Rogan one, he's like, oh, they would never let you make that movie. He was like bullshit. You can just make it. I just made it. Did you not see the last two films and how politically incorrect they were? And you know, I don't care what Bruce lee's, you know, fans think of how I portrayed Bruce lee. He was, he was a bad actor. He was a terrible human being too, These folks and he, his basic thing was everybody keeps waiting to ask for permission and he's like, I'm just gonna make my movies and let the chips fall where they may.

Um, that really inspired me to want to make movies because I saw that somebody could make a movie outside the system for so little money and that's why I may think for smoking. Um and we have another, we have another independent movie coming out next year about seven or dolly which you know finally got made after about 15 years. So um yeah, I mean he's inspired a lot of people and he shows what can be done.</mark>

But here's, here's what you're going through the pack of cards at Jason and said, I I never see you ever again. I never want to have you fucking playbook because I went to the pilots and I told them I'll give you five grand if you can make this flight last another hour. And they were like yeah we got a circle, we just kept circle it. I was like, I gotta get another hour and $550,000 on the fucking stupid trip. He never even wanted to come. You didn't want to go to the best michelin starred restaurant in, Oh my God, in boston. It's so fucking stuffy by the way, it's so stuffy and so stuff so seriously and they're trying to you know, bring you know 18 courses to us and you know big ideas and big guys.

I think it could be a trillion dollar company someday. 22 million members even through all the craziness that we talked about on this podcast, Uh you know, they're learning, they're fixing things and 22 million people using the product and they're gonna launch so many other products as part of it and all these young people getting financially literate.
